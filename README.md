# Tensorflow-Linear-Regression
Using Tensorflow Linear Regression on different datasets

* This is my first machine learning project.
* The project was used in my Cisco 2020 High School STEM Extern Capstone Project.
* I used this model to help predict student grades based on different student life factors such as student attendance or study time.
* The data/excel spreadsheet was from the UCI Machine Learning repository.

# Description
The code is in linearRegressionModel.ipynb. This code takes input from the dataset in which the one I have included is about different student life factors(studying time, traveling time, absences, etc.)
and the grades these students are getting (G3 in the spreadsheet). The model creates a linear model based off of this data. Running the code, will first train the model through epochs. By training the model,
 we are trying to obtain the lost possible loss score. Afterwards, the model should print out a matrix of two columns. The left column represents the score the model would predict based on the same conditions given
 and the the score on the right column represents the actual score/grade of the student.
